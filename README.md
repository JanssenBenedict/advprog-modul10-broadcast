<br><br>After running the server along with three of the clients and typing something in each client, it can be seen that the server functions as a listener that manages incoming connections from all clients. The server receives messages from each of the clients when they send them, and then they proceed to broadcast those messages to the other connected clients. This allows each client to send messages to other clients but also to receive messages sent by any other connected client in real time.
